# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together
## List-Example-Grader HELP!!!
### Student: Keroppi 
Hello! I am working on my ```List-Examples-Grader``` and ran into a problem. I have 3 test cases in my ```TestListExamples.java``` file. However, when I run ```bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected```, which I got from the week 6 lab sample submissions, the score is always out of 1 instead of 3. I think this might have something to do with my JUnit test in the ```TestLisstExamples.java``` or the ```CPATH``` I used, but nothing I tried is fixing the bug. What is wrong with my code? I included the output symptom below.
